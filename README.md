This is a list of tutorials from around the world to help you to learn to code on your own or with friends

Open Learn to Code - AU
================================

This is what they don't teach you in University.  This is the start of a self help unstructured self discovered way to let Australian School Kids and those that haven't had the opportunity to attend University learn practical coding and systems skills. 

This resource was created after the NSW Government closed the teachers school which taught teachers how to teach students to code.

It was inspired by the outstanding students who launched and run the [CREATE Club at UNSW,](http://www.createunsw.com.au/) basically Senior students who help junior students learn how to code, build robots and other generally cool stuff and also by [Ecole 42](https://www.42.us.org/) the 3 year free coding school funded by a French Billionaire.

We are seeking help in the following areas

 - Access to computer labs at Universities, TAFEs and libraries on an adhoc basis so that self helpers that don't have the funds for the latest Macbook still have somewhere to learn
 - Young (or old) Leaders to start meetups to encourage those who want to learn to gather in their local area to learn together (I promise you, you will get more out of this than you put in)
 - More learning resources to add to the collection. If you have a great link, please edit this file and add it.
 - A few Admins to help keep this repo in order and keep adding resources.

There are lots of gaps, please fill them...

Thanks

Tools
=====
Come back here to work out how to get what tools you need to get your code running. Some of the tutorials that follow may have self contained environments where everything is supplied in the browser but some of the older languages may require you to install tools on your machine.

Bitnami is a company who has developed a whole bunch of packaged installations to take the drudge work out of installing the various components that are needed to run modern web stacks, LAMP WAMP and MAMP are prepackaged Apache Web Server, MySQL Database and Php language installers.

[LAMP - Linux Apache MYSQL, PHP,](https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer)

[WAMP - Windows Apache MYSQL, PHP,](https://bitnami.com/stack/wamp)

[MAMP - Mac Apache MYSQL, PHP,](https://bitnami.com/stack/mamp)

Languages
=========
The basics
HTML/CSS
--------
HTML & CSS are the languages that control the layout, colours, fonts and images to display the data, functions and features that our web page and app code generates. There are a few well known frameworks that offer pre-built templates and code to make developing pages faster and more professional including BootStrap and Material Design.

[Quickly Build Your First Web Page with Material Design](https://gomix.com/#!/project/material-design)

[Learning to code your first web page](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/)

Javascript
----------
Javascript is what powers the functionality of most of our web interfaces. Although HTML and CSS is what gives us the look and feel, Javascript is what gives us the functionality to make the features work.

I found this super useful when trying to understand the basic structures of Javascript

JS Frameworks & Libraries
----------
Frameworks are pre written Javascript code that performs various functions needed to build web apps. There are literally dozens of these, here are the most popular with live demos and code.
[Angular](http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/)

[React](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/)

[JQuery](http://todomvc.com/examples/jquery/#/all)

There is a pretty extensive list of frameworks with demos and working code here http://todomvc.com/

Mobile
------

React
Swift
Java
Android
iOS
[AMP (Googles answer to Facebook Instant Articles)](https://www.ampproject.org/)


Python
------
Although relatively old this is still the language that powers large scale web backend services, primarily around scalable systems that require intensive computation, crawling and machine learning. Most of the popular machine learning frameworks use Python.

[enter link description here](https://www.learnpython.org/)
 
PHP
---
Bit old school now but basically powers a large chunk of the web in conjunction with MySQL. Wordpress was built on PHP and MySQL.
I know nothing about PHP, if you do, please edit this section and add tutorials.


NodeJS
------
Javascript for Servers and backend systems. Relatively new this has now come of age and is the preferred backend for most new web startups. It is basically Javascript from Google Chrome running in a server application, its extremely fast for serving applications or real time messaging or data.

Node forms part of [MEAN Stack](http://mean.io/) 

[GoMix - Real Time NodeJS Tutorial & Live Code Editor & Debugger](https://gomix.com/#!/project/node-beginner)

Express
-------
A front end framework which allows you to build Web apps to talk to NodeJS.

Socket.io
------
A real time message passing code to allow Web pages to get real time updates from NodeJS Application Servers.
[Quickly get a basic Socket.io demo running](https://gomix.com/#!/project/socketio-chat)

RabbitMQ
--------
RabbitMQ is a platform that allows your application processes to safely store messages, jobs to be done or data in a buffer until the other process that needs is ready to use it. It allows this data to be interconnected between dozens of languages and platforms

Publishers send data and Consumers use the data.

[RabbitMQ Hello World](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-java.html)

MQQT
----

Java
----
The go to language for building high scale rock solid platforms for banking and enterprise. Was the preferred solution for building scalable web platforms but is fast being replaced by NodeJS and other newcomers.

I know nothing about Java, if you do, please edit this section and add tutorials.

C, C#, C++
----------
Lower level language which is very fast. Many other higher lever languages and databases are written in C.
 
I know nothing about C, if you do, please edit this section and add tutorials.


Databases
=========
Databases can be basically divided into 4 camps.

 - SQL = Structured Query Language, older style, strict construction, good because they generally enforce rules and methods that keep data safe and consistent.
 - NonSQL = Document based, unstructured, good/fast for prototyping but need care for data consistency, can be highly scalable 
 - Graph Databases = setup for complex multidimensional data relationships
 - Key Pair Databases = Super high performance, low complexity data where the programmer handles the rules and logic and enforces the data integrity.
 - 

MongoDB
-------
New age database, basically everyone is learning Mongo, NodeJS, Angular. 

Very scalable, very easy to prototype with, can be configured to be highly fault tolerant, has some features around data consistency which can bite if not implemented properly.

Redis
-----
New age, highly scalable, hardcore database for high volume low complexity data models that need reliability and speed. Twitter uses this at the data layer that supplies your personal tweet timeline to the client.

MySQL
-----
Bit old school but basically still powers a massive chunk of the worlds webservers.

Machine Learning
================
This is a super hot space, mostly built with Python, 2016 has been the year that Google, Facebook and AWS have released numerous open source contributions to the space. The biggest challenge now is getting enough data for your chosen field and applying it.

DevOps & System Admin
=====================

We used to call this area Systems Admin but the truth is that so many of these roles have morphed from system administrators into what we called DevOps ie they have responsibility for keeping your live webservice running. It's an important and massively growing field and one you won't find in most University courses.

Docker
------
Docker is fast becoming the preferred way to release applications. It allows you to build a self contained version of everything your application needs to run and release that to the world on a container which will run on virtually any platform. 

It removes so many of the headaches of writing and deploying code to the cloud where code runs on one platform but won't run on the production platform.

With the release of Docker Swarm it is also the most highly scalable web deployment platform that allows Devops to cluster 1000s of machines together across multiple platforms and launch applications in docker containers in the 1000s.
